General Technical Approach:
	Have you wanted to become a Pilot but have so many questions? Well, this app, “To Be a Pilot” has all the answers. This application will allow you to find information on how to find a flight school, to finding the best-written studying tips, and finally passing your check ride! As a student, it’s important to have questions, this application will allow for ease of use when exploring the aviation world. As a student, it's important to understand where to find critical information, such as where to get started, what to look for in a flight school, and how to find a great instructor. These topics will be covered inside this application on biases of questions and answers with explanations. An application like this will allow you to immerse yourself in aviation terms, meanings, and feelings. It's time to get started on the journey for the check ride (Check ride = The final tests to determine your ability to be a Private Pilot).  This application will use loops to regroup questions, if a person doesn’t understand a subject, a better explanation will be displayed in the end.  
Application Logic Design:
 


Risks and Issues:
•	Providing bias  
o	An example of this would the author trying to persuade the audience to choose one flight school over another. This application should be bias-free and accept all flight schools. 
•	Providing duplicate & false information 
o	An issue with aviation is the amount of information available. It is a big deal when it comes to finding the right information. No one wants to go into a flight school with misinformation. It is important to have the unique CORRECT information to reduce the misinformation in the community. 
•	Loop errors
o	This application will have many loops in it to provide an answer for each question. It will be important to make sure each loop is connected with each section. This will mean this code needs to be organized correctly and clean.
•	File details 
o	This application will need separate text documents for each topic. This will mean each document will be called each time a question is picked. It will be necessary to have each document labeled properly or else it could lead to a missing Q&A. 
•	Organization 
o	The application will contain many blocks of code due to the amount of text that will be required. Text will need to be organized by numbers, see below:
1.	QUESTION
2.	ANSWER
